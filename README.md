Sample using Spark SDK and MongoDB 

This sample was used to show Spark capabilities to interact with ChatBots.

An inventory Bot, look for RMA order numbers and return de status.

The inventory is located on a MongoDB

The code use Spark SDK library to reduce code lines using APIs
Also use Pymongo as MongoDB SDK to join local database

I will update code in case you want to use MongoDB Atlas, the cloud version

NOTICE: Main code is based on Python2, because Pymongo us based on Python2 as well
